# Open Source and AI in Speech, Speech-To-Text, Text-To-Speech

Open source and AI in speech, Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) are rapidly becoming more important as the technology continues to develop and become more accessible. Open source software and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are driving advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and conversational AI, allowing for more natural interactions between humans and machines. 

## What is Open Source? 

Open source is a term used to describe software that has been released under open source licenses. These licenses allow for users to copy, modify, and redistribute the software without any cost or restriction. This allows for collaboration among developers and a wider base of users who can contribute to the softwareâ€™s development and improvement.

## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? 

AI is a field of computer science that focuses on creating machines that can think and act like humans. This includes tasks such as recognizing patterns, solving problems, and making decisions. AI can be used to enhance existing software and create new technologies that reduce human effort. 

## What is Speech-To-Text (STT)?

Speech-to-text (STT) is a technology that converts audio input such as speech into text. It can be used to transcribe conversations, dictate commands, create documents, and more. 

## What is Text-To-Speech (TTS)?

Text-to-speech (TTS) is a technology that converts text into speech. It can be used to read aloud text, create audio documents, and more.
